# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Building a Machine Learning model to predict the customer churn or retention of a telecom industry

After trying the senstivity and accuracy and all the impoertant factors of logistic regression models and descision tree models, I setteled on a logistic regression model.

#### Steps Involved:
* Preprocessing the data.
* Conducting appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights.
* Deriving new features.
* Reducing the number of variables using PCA.
* Training a variety of models, tuning model hyperparameters, etc.
* Evaluating the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
* Finally, choosing a Logistic Regression model based on evaluation metrics.

#### Churn Predictions

- Identify the customers whose minutes of usage decreassed from good pahse to action phase and deal with them they are more likely to churned
- Identify the customers whose total outgoing calls are low in august, they are more likely to be churned
- Identify the customers whose monthly internet recharges are low in august, they are more likely to be churned 
- Identify the customers whose local and international incomming calls are low in august, they are more likely to be churned 
- Identify the customers whose STD incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T for the month of August are more likely to churn
